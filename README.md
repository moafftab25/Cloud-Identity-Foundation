#Cloud Identity Foundations

I am creating this repository to document 
and farm my knowledge related Identity-First
Cloud foundation based on Microsoft Entra ID and Azure.

The goal of this project is design, document and ask a
lot of why's as to how to Identity, access control and
security should work in a real organization.

This repository is not to be seen as a tutorial.
My intention is to keep this as a design plus
reasoning project focused on below.
- Identity as Control Panel
- Security-first access
- Realiability and failure awareness
- Practical trade-offs

The project evolves incrementally and reflects real-work constraints.
